    "Estimating sparse precision matrices is an important problem in various statistical areas, such as principal component analysis and graphical models. For example, under Gaussian graphical models, estimating the support of the precision matrix allows one to recover the conditional dependence between components of a graph. Precision matrix estimation is generally computationally expensive, which is further exarcerbated by high-dimensional settings, particularly when the number of parameters, $p$, exceeds the sample size, $n$. Several algorithms have been developed in recent years to address these issues. The goal of this project is to implement one such algorithm - the constrained â„“1 minimization estimator (CLIME), which is an efficient and accurate tool in estimating sparse precision matrices (Cai, et al., 2011). \n",
    "\n",
    "This project implements a fast version of CLIME using the parametric simplex method (PSM) (Vanderbei, 2008; Pang, et al., 2014). A Python implementation would enhance efficiency and scalability compared to the existing `R` package `fastclime`. Additionally, the code leverages existing C code for the PSM linear programming (LP) solver to further speed up performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following report, I present a stable, well-tested version of `fastclime` in Python. Results include numerical benchmarking under simulated data and comparison to existing state-of-the-art algorithms that solve a similar family of problems in precision matrix estimation. The Python implementation of `fastclime` performs comparably to the `R` version in terms of speed when tested against a wide range of data with fixed sample size and varying number of predictors. Additionally, `fastclime` results are favorable compared to existing algorithms for precision matrix estimation. A section on ongoing/future work extends the CLIME estimation problem to the case when covariates are involved."

    "###Regularization parameter selection in `fastclime` and `CAPME`\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, the choice of regularization parameter is critical to valid statistical inference of precision matrices. In this project, AIC and BIC were considered. However, these metrics work well for the case when $n > p$, but not $n < p$. Cross-validation is another popular method, but does not perform well when $p > n$, is computationally expensive, and wastes valuable training data. An alternative method, which I plan to make available in a future version of this project, is the stability approach to regularization selection (stars), which has been shown to outperform competing state-of-the-art procedures in regularization parameter selection (Liu, et al., 2010). \n",

    "To my knowledge, the current implementation of `fastclime` in Python is the fastest implementation of the CLIME algorithm. However, it can be made even faster through parallezation via GPU processing. The solution to the CLIME/CAPME problems are easily parallelizable as one only needs to solve to solution for each column in the dataset. "
